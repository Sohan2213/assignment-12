Unity Catalog Metastore Setup: First, enable Unity Catalog in your Azure Databricks environment, which allows for unified governance across all Databricks workspaces in the account. The metastore will manage metadata for tables, views, and other data assets.

Root Storage Account for Metastore: Create an Azure Storage Account that will serve as the root storage for Unity Catalog. This storage will store the actual data for managed tables in Unity Catalog.

Azure Databricks Access Connector: Create an Azure Databricks Access Connector, which allows secure access to the storage account from Databricks without managing credentials directly. Assign the appropriate roles to this connector so it has access to the storage account.

Create Metastore in Account Console: In the Databricks Account Console, create a new metastore linked to the root storage account. This metastore will now track and manage all Unity Catalog metadata.

Create Catalog and Managed Table: Create a catalog in Unity Catalog using SQL commands in Databricks. Then create a managed table, where both metadata and data are managed by the metastore.

Create External Table: For external tables, store the data outside of the managed Databricks storage, typically in an Azure Data Lake or Blob Storage. The metastore will manage only the metadata, but the data will remain in its external location.

Row-Level Security and Column Filtering with Dynamic Views: Implement row-level security and column filtering using dynamic views. Dynamic views allow you to create customized views where specific users or groups only have access to particular rows or columns of the table, ensuring granular security controls.
